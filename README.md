# Node Graph Search Algorithms
This is a program that utilizes a GUI to choose between 4 different search methods. The GUI will give you an option to select an input file --this is where the Test Files folder comes in handy-- 
and after an input file is selected, a graph of the nodes will be created and you will need to select whether you would like to run the DelivA code file, DelivB, DelivC, or DelivD. Within each Test File folder, there is a more in depth description of how each search algorithm (A,B,C,D) will work.

Many Data Structures & Algorithms concepts are utilized throughout these programs to effectively create and traverse a graph of interconnected nodes.
